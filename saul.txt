The Odds of Jimmy McGill Pulling 6 B's in a Row

*SPOILERS for Season One of Better Call Saul*

I'm on another rewatch of AMC's Better Call Saul, and this time, I noticed something that looked pretty unlikely in season one's finale, Marco. About ten minutes into the episode, we see our protagonist, Jimmy McGill, calling a game of bingo in an effort to promote his reputation with his client base, the elder population of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Just before this, Jimmy went through a pretty ugly scene with his brother Chuck, who, after over a year of Jimmy's financial support, admitted he didn't believe Jimmy could ever revert from his petty crime habits.

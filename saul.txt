The Odds of Jimmy McGill Pulling 6 B's in a Row

*SPOILERS for Season One of Better Call Saul*

I'm on another rewatch of AMC's Better Call Saul, and this time, I noticed something that looked pretty unlikely in season one's finale, Marco. About ten minutes into the episode, we see our protagonist, Jimmy McGill, calling a game of bingo at a retirement home in an effort to promote his reputation with his client base in Albuquerque. Just before this, Jimmy went through a pretty ugly scene with his brother Chuck, who, after over a year of Jimmy's financial support, admitted he didn't believe Jimmy could ever revert from his petty crime habits. What leads to Jimmy's explosive narrative in the retirement home, indirectly, is his decision to follow up for every number he calls out with a word or name that starts with the letter of that number.

We watch Jimmy pull a B, a subtle reminder to him (and not so subtle of a reminder to ourselves) about the falling out with his brother. And then he pulls another B. And another after that. And then three more. With each successive B, we see him get more flustered as he's trapped himself with this highly unlikely but consistent reminder of his nagging brother who compares him and his law degree to a "chimp with a machine gun." He starts off calling out the B's casually enough-- "B-2! Just like the B2 bomber... B-4, another B! How about that, as in, 'Before too long, we're gonna have another winner.'" By the fifth, though, we can see him getting thoroughly aggravated-- "B-5 as in, 'Boy, this B thing is really starting to tick me off.'"
